      <p>WordBlob is a simple anagram game. In each level, you are given a scrambled word and have 30 seconds to find as many letter combinations as possible. 
        <p>In singleplayer, you are able to progress by completing subsequent levels.  </p>
        <p>In multiplayer, one player plays first while the other plays after. The scores are then compared!</p>
